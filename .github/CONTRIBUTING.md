# Contributing
Contributing to the Teecontrol Course Data plugin is very welcome and will be fully credited.

Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Etiquette
This project is open source, and as such, the maintainers build and maintain the source code in their free time. The code is made freely available so that can be use to other developers. It would be unfair for them to suffer abuse or anger for their hard work.

Please be considerate towards maintainers when raising issues or presenting pull requests. Let's be civilized and selfless people.

It may very well be possible that issues or pull requests are now answered quickly due to the available time of the maintainers. Please be patient when waiting for an answer. If you are a paying customer of Teecontrol, please contact the Teecontrol helpdesk.

Opinions may differ. Maintainers will always ensure that a submission is of sufficient quality and will benefit the project. It's possible that a maintainer will make another decision. Always respect the decision made by the maintainer. Don't get upset or be abusive when your submission is not used.

## Viability

When requesting or submitting a feature, first consider if it is either useful to others. This plugin is created to provide fundamentals for all developers. Custom code or features do not belong in the open source project.

## Procedure
Before filing an issue:
- Attempt to replicate the problem, to ensure that it wasn't a coincidental incident.
- Check to make sure your feature suggestion isn't already present within the project.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress.
- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.

Before submitting a pull request:
- Check the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist.
- Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.

## Requirements
If the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.
- PSR-12 Coding Standard - The project is shipped with [laravel/pint](https://laravel.com/docs/pint) to make sure your code can be changed according to the code standard.
- Document any change in behaviour - Make sure the README.md and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- Consider our release cycle - We try to follow SemVer v2.0.0. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- One pull request per feature - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- Send coherent history - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.

We hope this will help you to contribute to our project.
